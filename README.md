# RU-Hacks-2020

With Bounty, the idea that people who are already going grocery shopping for themselves can pick up a few extra items for a 
user along the way and deliver it to their door, thus allowing the user to have fresh groceries without struggling to make a 
decision between nutritional wellbeing and physical well being. Individuals who sign up for the app choose between a volunteer
or a user, and are able to place their address into the service. Since it is location based, volunteers will be able to choose
which shopping list orders they fulfill and the user can see the closest volunteer to their location.Users can select multiple places they want to get groceries from and note it down in their shopping list. Once the list is accepted, the volunteer will drop the groceries off at the userâ€™s place of residence and receive monetary compensation for the groceries. 

The web application has 5 different modern web pages, showing different components of our service, such as the user's location 
and a sample of a shopping list entered by the user. The user first registers for an account, entering their email address
and phone number, so it is more convenient for them to contact the volunteer. The use of Google API allows the user to locate 
themselves and would essentially notifies the volunteer of their location. It also picks the closest volunteer with a blue 
pointer on the page. Due to the current Covid-19 situation, we also provided users with a link to educate themselves about Covid
as well as the precautions they should take to protect themselves.
